# SimpleNFT Project

This Solidity program implements a simple NFT (Non-Fungible Token) contract named "Project1" with basic NFT functionalities like adding and minting NFTs. It serves as an introduction to Solidity and NFT mechanics on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

This contract, written in Solidity, defines a simple NFT system. It includes functions to add new NFTs and mint them to specific addresses, tracking the total number of NFTs and their ownership. This project is ideal for beginners looking to understand Solidity concepts.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Visit [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

#### 1. Create a New File:

Click the "+" icon in the left sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g. Project1.sol).

#### 2. Copy and Paste the Code given in the [Project_1](https://github.com/Panshuu/ETH_AVAX_Project_1/blob/main/Project_1) file.

#### 3. Compile the Code:

Click the "Solidity Compiler" tab. Ensure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.9". Click "Compile Project1.sol".

#### 4. Deploy the Contract:

Click the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab. Select "Project1" from the dropdown menu. Click "Deploy".

#### 5. Interact with the Contract:

Call addNFT to add new NFTs by specifying the name and region. Call mintNFT to mint an NFT to a specific address by specifying the address and NFT ID. Call getNFT to get the details of a specific NFT by specifying the NFT ID. The contract updates the list of NFTs and their ownership accordingly.
